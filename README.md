This repository shows my first web project, it may be a little messed up because I didnÂ´t know I could organize the stuffs in that time hahah but I had tried my best :D 

Project Neon: First Web Project!

I made this project as a dynamic web page that showcases a fictional character named Neon, in that time, my teacher proposed us to make a web page of any characters or celebrity. In this source I featured content such as images, videos, and descriptions. 
It was created as a first web development project, utilizing HTML and CSS to design a visually appealing and responsive website.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling, including responsiveness for tablets and mobile devices.
Google Fonts: Custom fonts for enhanced aesthetics.
Images and Media: Various images to enhance the visual appeal.
